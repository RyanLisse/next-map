While humans are biologically evolved to live on land, we were also able to build boats to travel on water and planes to fly above the clouds. Just like in the Mediterranean, the South Sea of Asia also were the birthplace of two major sea faring civilization:

- The Malay sea-faring people of Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. 
- The Southern Chinese sea-faring people of the Yangtze and Pearl River Delta.
