### The Heart of East Asia Sea Faring People

The ability to regulate body temperature with blood circulation makes the mammal branches extremely adaptive. After the first mammal took its first step on land, the mammal branch of animal kingdoms quickly evolved from mouses living under the domination of the dinosaurs into modern humans who dominated all climates and terrains with our tools.

While humans are biologically evolved to live on land, we were also able to build boats to travel on water and planes to fly above the clouds. Just like in the Mediterranean, the South Sea of Asia also were the birthplace of two major sea faring civilization:

- The Malay sea-faring people of Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. 
- The Southern Chinese sea-faring people of the Yangtze and Pearl River Delta.

Boneo is the third largest island in the world, two times the size of Japan and three times the size of England. Boneo is located 1000 kilometers from the Mouth of the Mekong river near Ho Chi Minh city. Yangtze river delta people made it to Japan to spread their alphabets so it is very likely that the Mekong delta people also made it to Boneo island.

Boneo island with the shape of a human heart was very likely the capital of a Pirate Sea Faring civilization of the Malay people. 
Boneo in underground Vietnamese means Place to Anchor. After the colonization of the Dutch and British in the 1500s,  the pirates' capital of Boneo was demolished and turned into a palm oil cultivation. The police stations of Singapore were installed near Boneo to watch over any Malay or Chinese rebellions. 

Boneo island then divided into three parts that belong to the modern day kingdom of Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia.

### The Secret Police Capital of British Empire
Singapore is the modern day capital of the Malay sea faring people and Hong Kong is the modern day capital of the Southern Chinese sea faring people. Interestingly enough, the capital of these two seafaring empires are still extremely bright at night today.
