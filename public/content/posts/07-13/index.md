### From An Apple of Knowledge To A Mexican Standoff
Why do these European countries call Eng-LAND, Switzer-LAND, Fin-LAND and Po-LAND ? And some other Central Asian countries call Turkmeni-STAN, Afghani-STAN, Uzbeki-STAN, Kyrgyz-STAN, Paki-STAN and Kazah-STAN with STAN meaning LAND in Persian. 

It is like a group of Caucasian men sitting down together in the mountain valley of Georgia in the Caucasus region after finishing the discovery of the known world and starting to re-arrange people tribes like Chess pieces into specialized regions of the World.  

![The Caucasus Secret Conference](content/posts/07-13/the_secret_caucasian_conference.png)

There is no absolute evidence that Eng-Land means the Land of Engineer but the best Engine in the World for the F22 was made in collaboration between North East American engineers and British engineers, the Nuclear Bomb was invented by British and American scientists as well as the Digital Computers. Fin-LAND has the largest ocean container fleet in the world, Po-LAND hosts the secret services of Eastern Europe and Switzer-LAND makes baby formula milk, cheese and Glock handgun. 

The most leading edge and up to date Technical Knowledge from Computer, Electrical, Material, Chemical and Nuclear Engineering are in English. The French and the Korean Engineers who design and build Nuclear Reactors nowaday all speak English with their colleagues.

By recruiting and moving best Scientists and Engineers first to England and then the United States in early 1700 and teaching them a common language since early ages, the Caucasian planners can ensure the perpetual leading edge in Productivity via Engineering Innovation over other Asian powers like China and India who were holding advantages in Population counts. 

After 200 years of continuous Engineering innovation, at the beginning of 1900 with Woodrow Wilson as president of United States, two English speaking countries: US and UK, were the number one and number two economies in the world with only 160 million people total but produced 6 times the output of 900 million Indian and Chinese. The process of converting Coal and Oil into output in the Combustion Engine, West of the Caucasus was outpacing the process of converting Food and Water into output in the Human Digest System, East of the Caucasus.

And then in 1930, 10 years before World War 2, The Institute of Advanced Studies was founded in Princeton, New Jersey to host the best scientists in Mathematics, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences immigrated from Europe after the destruction of World War 1. 10 years laters, the three residents of these Advanced Institutes, John Von Newman, Albert Einstein and Oppenhimer contributed greatly to the Manhattan Project and the United States domination of world affairs after World War 2.

#### The Trinity Test and The First Attempt At Manipulating Nature at Sub Atomic Level

The detonation of the first Atom Bomb at the Trinity Test site is a major upgrade of the US Caucasian North Atlantics weapon arsenals in their expansion West toward East Asia and South toward Latin America. 

From Trinity test, the first nuclear explosion to the meeting of supreme leader Un and Donald the Duck in Hanoi, we have come a long way. A scientific discovery that has the potential turn thin air into unlimited energy has becoming the potential for a human extinction event. 

![The Nuclear Chain Reaction](content/posts/07-13/the_chain_reaction.png)

Nuclear weapon is a device that can create explosive energy from the nuclear chain reactions either through fission process (the breaking up of nuclear material) or both the combination of fusion and fission process (the combining and breaking up for nuclear materials) in a thermal nuclear bomb.

![The Atomic Bomb Dome](content/posts/07-13/atomic_bomb_dome.png)

Tsar Bomba is the most powerful nuclear weapon ever created and it is an example of a thermal nuclear bomb. Nuclear weapons have only been used twice by US on Japan and had little effect on the outcome of World War II but had a massive effect on United States geographical and genetics advantages. 

![WW2 Japan Nuker](content/posts/07-13/ww2_japan_nuker.png)

By dropping two atomic bombs, the Little Boy and Fat Man nuclear bombs, on two non-essential targets: Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the Enola Gay bomber, the US was able turn Japan from a hostile enemy into an obedient ally. Hiroshima and Nagasaki, like Hanoi and Nanning, are trading ports for Sex Slaves with the West. Most of the Sex Slaves are XOs which are sacrificable. 

![Japan Major Human Settlements](content/posts/07-13/hiroshima_vs_tokyo.png)

By NUKING non-essential targets to demonstrate America's ability to cause much larger damage to the Empire of Japan more important targets, America was able to turn Japan from a hostile enemy into an obedient ally. 

The event altered United States geographical advatanges by eliminating any Pacific Ocean threats and stationing Forward Military Bases directly on East Asian doorsteps at South Korea, Okinawa, Taiwan, Guam and the Philipine. The US mainland became the safest place on earth to store your assets and raise your family. As the result, The US can expand their Genetics options by drawing a massive amount of immigrations from Europe and Asia to US Mainland.

![US East Asia Forward Basses](content/posts/07-13/us_east_asia_forward_bases.png)

The Trinity site in New Mexico, a very strategic location, was picked by Oppenhimer as the location for the testing of the first Atomic Bomb built under the Manhattan project. The Trinity test site is located at the intersection of the Mexican Rio Grande river and the only major flat land area connecting US Hispanic West Coast and US Caucasian East Coast through the Rocky mountain range. 

![The Trinity Test Site](content/posts/07-13/Trinity_Nuclear_Testsite.png)

From day 1, nuclear research main focus was to create a super weapon not an infinite energy source though because it was done by British and American. Thats why Uranium-based nuclear weapon research was prioritzied over Thorium-based nuclear energy research. The low fertility rate of Caucasian women makes Caucasian men religiously chose to expand their genetic footprints by eliminating males and capturing females from other cultures. Other cultures in Africa, India and Asia only need to expand their genetic footprints by keeping their women well fed and their home well lit. 

Any attempts by Non-NATO countries to conduct nuclear energy research and expand nuclear energy generation would be severely disrupted or limited by NATO countries. Nuclear power generators are very geographical independent and difficult to throttle. One can put a nuclear power generator on submarine, aircraft carrier and even plane and it would run for years. Oil and gas is concerntrated in the Middle East, Gulf of Mexico and Siberia which could be controlled and throttled by NATO or Russia. 

![Fukushima Nuclear Accident](content/posts/07-13/Fukushima_Nuclear_Accidents.png)

Maybe the Fukushima nuclear accident was American-made to throttle the growth of Japanese economy and population. And the North Korean secret services blow up the port of Beirut, Lebanon with fertilizers as a Joke to the NATO attempts at stopping North Korean nuclear program and containing China because of Chinese women high fertility rate.

#### The Development of Nuclear Ballistic Missiles

The V1 of Nazi Germany was the first attempt at building the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile of Caucasian scientists during World War 2. While the  V1 missile is much more expensive to build and can not carry the same amount of payload that Russian artillery and American long range bombers can deliver on German troop formations, manufacturing facilities and major cities. 

![German V2 Campaign on London](content/posts/07-13/german_v2_campaign_on_london.png)

After the conclusion of World War 2, many Nazi scientists who surrendered were moved to the United States, continuing to work on American weapon development programs and raising their family there. 

The combination of British engineers’ nuclear weapon research and German engineers’ ballistic missile research led to the development and mass production of the Nuclear Intercontinental Ballistic Missile or nuclear ICBM. 

A nuclear warhead has a much higher explosive power to weight ratio than a conventional warhead and an ICBM has much higher speed and range than conventional ballistic projectiles of artillery and ariel bombers. 

![Minuteman 3 ICBM](content/posts/07-13/minuteman_3_icbm.png)

An American Minuteman III ICBM can deliver the explosive power equivalent to 350 000 TON of TNT in a 360 Kilogram warhead, can travel up to 15000 KM at the speed of up to 28000 kilometer an hour and close the distance between Hanoi and New York in 30 minutes. 

The combination of explosive power, range and speed in an ICBM outperforms any weapon of war that humans ever invented. Any major city with an area less than 350 square kilometers like  Kiev, Phoenix or Seoul could be wiped out with a one single Minuteman III ICBM.

![Phoenix Urban Area](content/posts/07-13/phoenix_urban_area.png)

#### The Cold War and Mutual Assured Destruction Doctrine
Oppenhimer, the father of the Atomic bomb, is a Communist sympathizer according to the FBI agents of the American government. Maybe he realized that Nuclear power and Nuclear weapons are too powerful a leverage that not a single man or a small group of people should have monopoly control of these powers. So Oppenhimer and other researchers in the Manhattan projects once again played the Prometheus role and gave the Nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union first and then France, UK, China and India. 

![Nuclear Tests Map](content/posts/07-13/nuclear_tests_map.png)

The dangerous nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union actually prevents the unrestrained usages of Nuclear Weapons by United States Armed Forces and Governments and only resulted in Nuclear Tests and Nuclear Stockpiles. 

Militaries started to put nuclear detonators everywhere they could. The US and the Soviet Union developed Nuclear Bombs, Nuclear-Tipped Ballistic missiles, Nuclear Cruise Missiles, Nuclear Torpedoes, Nuclear artillery cells and even Nuclear grenade launchers.

![Nuclear grenade launcher](content/posts/07-13/nuclear_grenade_launcher.png)

During these Nuclear Arm Races, military thinkers from the United States and USSR started to develop the Mutual Assured Destruction doctrine. If you can hold enough enemy cities and arm forces at risk and guarantee your ability to counter strike in the case of a nuclear first strike from enemies.

![US ICBM Triangle](content/posts/07-13/dangerous_ICBM_triangles.png) 

The MAD doctrine justified the mass production of nuclear weapons and its delivery mechanism as well as the increasingly more advanced command control network of the Nuclear force.

![Malmstrom_ICBM_Missile_Silos](content/posts/07-13/Malmstrom_ICBM_Missile_Silos.png)

By 1990, the United States and Russia possessed enough nuclear weapons to flatten all major cities or 50% of each other's land surfaces within one hour. So it is insane for the US or Russia to have a total nuclear war against each other since that would be a double succide.

### An Unstable Nash Equilibrium In A Multi-Polars World
#### The Collapse of Soviet Union and Its Nuclear Capability

After the collapse of Soviet Union in 1990s, the world balance of power is moving from a Bi-Polars into an Uni Polar with the United States becomes the dominating power. After the failed arm race, So Viet union is being pushed into a defensive position, holding on to its collaping coalitions.

#### The Nuclear Winter Unproven Theory

#### 21 Century Human Capability to Adapt and Rebuild
The Cold War and the constant nuclear threats altered the genetic makeup of US major cities. Caucasian wealthy families would move to the Sub-Urban and Countryside and drive few hours downtown to work in the morning. Major US city centers are now filled with African American and other low income families.
