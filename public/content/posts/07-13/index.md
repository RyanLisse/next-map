### From An Apple of Knowledge To A Mexican Standoff
Why do these European countries call Eng-LAND, Switzer-LAND, Fin-LAND and Po-LAND ? And some other Central Asian countries call Turkmeni-STAN, Afghani-STAN, Uzbeki-STAN, Kyrgyz-STAN, Paki-STAN and Kazah-STAN with STAN meaning LAND in Persian. 

It is like a group of Caucasian men sitting down together in the mountain valley of Georgia in the Caucasus region after finishing the discovery of the known world and starting to re-arrange people tribes like Chess pieces into specialized regions of the World.  

![The Caucasus Secret Conference](content/posts/07-13/the_secret_caucasian_conference.png)

There is no absolute evidence that Eng-Land means the Land of Engineer but the best Engine in the World for the F22 was made in collaboration between North East American engineers and British engineers, the Nuclear Bomb was invented by British and American scientists as well as the Digital Computers. Fin-LAND has the largest ocean container fleet in the world, Po-LAND hosts the secret services of Eastern Europe and Switzer-LAND makes baby formula milk, cheese and Glock handgun. 

The most leading edge and up to date Technical Knowledge from Computer, Electrical, Material, Chemical and Nuclear Engineering are in English. The French and the Korean Engineers who design and build Nuclear Reactors nowaday all speak English with their colleagues.

By recruiting and moving best Scientists and Engineers first to England and then the United States in early 1700 and teaching them a common language since early ages, the Caucasian planners can ensure the perpetual leading edge in Productivity via Engineering Innovation over other Asian powers like China and India who were holding advantages in Population counts. 

After 200 years of continuous Engineering innovation, at the beginning of 1900 with Woodrow Wilson as president of United States, two English speaking countries: US and UK, were the number one and number two economies in the world with only 160 million people total but produced 6 times the output of 900 million Indian and Chinese. The process of converting Coal and Oil into output in the Combustion Engine, West of the Caucasus was outpacing the process of converting Food and Water into output in the Human Digest System, East of the Caucasus.

And then in 1930, 10 years before World War 2, The Institute of Advanced Studies was founded in Princeton, New Jersey to host the best scientists in Mathematics, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences immigrated from Europe after the destruction of World War 1. 10 years laters, the three residents of these Advanced Institutes, John Von Newman, Albert Einstein and Oppenhimer contributed greatly to the Manhattan Project and the United States domination of world affairs after World War 2.

#### The Trinity Test and The First Attempt At Manipulating Nature at Sub Atomic Level

The detonation of the first Atom Bomb at the Trinity Test site is a major upgrade of the US Caucasian North Atlantics weapon arsenals in their expansion West toward East Asia and South toward Latin America. 

From Trinity test, the first nuclear explosion to the meeting of supreme leader Un and Donald the Duck in Hanoi, we have come a long way. A scientific discovery that has the potential turn thin air into unlimited energy has becoming the potential for a human extinction event. 

![The Nuclear Chain Reaction](content/posts/07-13/the_chain_reaction.png)

Nuclear weapon is a device that can create explosive energy from the nuclear chain reactions either through fission process (the breaking up of nuclear material) or both the combination of fusion and fission process (the combining and breaking up for nuclear materials) in a thermal nuclear bomb.

![The Atomic Bomb Dome](content/posts/07-13/atomic_bomb_dome.png)

Tsar Bomba is the most powerful nuclear weapon ever created and it is an example of a thermal nuclear bomb. Nuclear weapons have only been used twice by US on Japan and had little effect on the outcome of World War II but had a massive effect on United States geographical and genetics advantages. 

![WW2 Japan Nuker](content/posts/07-13/ww2_japan_nuker.png)

By dropping two atomic bombs, the Little Boy and Fat Man nuclear bombs, on two non-essential targets: Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the Enola Gay bomber, the US was able turn Japan from a hostile enemy into an obedient ally. Hiroshima and Nagasaki, like Hanoi and Nanning, are trading ports for Sex Slaves with the West. Most of the Sex Slaves are XOs which are sacrificable. 

![Japan Major Human Settlements](content/posts/07-13/hiroshima_vs_tokyo.png)

By NUKING non-essential targets to demonstrate America's ability to cause much larger damage to the Empire of Japan more important targets, America was able to turn Japan from a hostile enemy into an obedient ally. 

The event altered United States geographical advatanges by eliminating any Pacific Ocean threats and stationing Forward Military Bases directly on East Asian doorsteps at South Korea, Okinawa, Taiwan, Guam and the Philipine. The US mainland became the safest place on earth to store your assets and raise your family. As the result, The US can expand their Genetics options by drawing a massive amount of immigrations from Europe and Asia to US Mainland.

![US East Asia Forward Basses](content/posts/07-13/us_east_asia_forward_bases.png)

The Trinity site in New Mexico, a very strategic location, was picked by Oppenhimer as the location for the testing of the first Atomic Bomb built under the Manhattan project. The Trinity test site is located at the intersection of the Mexican Rio Grande river and the only major flat land area connecting US Hispanic West Coast and US Caucasian East Coast through the Rocky mountain range. 

![The Trinity Test Site](content/posts/07-13/Trinity_Nuclear_Testsite.png)

From day 1, nuclear research main focus was to create a super weapon not an infinite energy source though because it was done by British and American. Thats why Uranium-based nuclear weapon research was prioritzied over Thorium-based nuclear energy research. The low fertility rate of Caucasian women makes Caucasian men religiously chose to expand their genetic footprints by eliminating males and capturing females from other cultures. Other cultures in Africa, India and Asia only need to expand their genetic footprints by keeping their women well fed and their home well lit. 

Any attempts by Non-NATO countries to conduct nuclear energy research and expand nuclear energy generation would be severely disrupted or limited by NATO countries. Nuclear power generators are very geographical independent and difficult to throttle. One can put a nuclear power generator on submarine, aircraft carrier and even plane and it would run for years. Oil and gas is concerntrated in the Middle East, Gulf of Mexico and Siberia which could be controlled and throttled by NATO or Russia. 

![Fukushima Nuclear Accident](content/posts/07-13/Fukushima_Nuclear_Accidents.png)

Maybe the Fukushima nuclear accident was American-made to throttle the growth of Japanese economy and population. And the North Korean secret services blow up the port of Beirut, Lebanon with fertilizers as a Joke to the NATO attempts at stopping North Korean nuclear program and containing China because of Chinese women high fertility rate.

![Nuclear Warheads by Countries](content/posts/07-13/israel_vs_major_cities.png)

The Cold War and the constant nuclear threats altered the genetic makeup of US major cities. Caucasian wealthy families would move to the Sub-Urban and Countryside and drive few hours downtown to work in the morning. Major US city centers are now filled with African American and other low income families.

### An Unstable Nash Equilibrium In A Multi-Polars World
#### The Collapse of Soviet Union and Its Nuclear Capability

After the collapse of Soviet Union in 1990s, the world balance of power is moving from a Bi-Polars into an Uni Polar with the United States becomes the dominating power. After the failed arm race, So Viet union is being pushed into a defensive position, holding on to its collaping coalitions.

### Particle Physics and The Obsolescence of Nuclear Deterrence

#### Antimatter Energy and Its New Way To Make Bigger and Cleaner Explosion
What is the most efficient way to convert mass to energy. Current most efficient way we are using is Nuclear Fission process. However, by annihilating matter with antimatter, it is exponentially more efficient. Converting mass to energy is the equation behind every weapon as well as engine ever created by human kind.  

As a result, antimatter explosion is much larger, more efficient and do not result in nuclear fallout. 
A 10kg antimatter bomb would cause a gigantic 230 megaton explosion which is more than 4 time larger than the largest nuclear bomb Tsar that yielding 50 Megaton explosion and 1000 times larger that the Fat Man dropped on Nagasaki in 1945.

Procuding anti-matter is astronomically expensive and only possible using massive particle acclerators. However, harvesting anti-matter using Penning Trap Satelites in the Van Allen radiation belt is much more feasible.


#### The Discovery of Neutrino Oscillation and Its Ability to Wipe out Nuclear Submarines Fleet

In 2015, the discovery of neutrino oscillation by Takaaki Kajita and Arther B. McDonald has shredded light for a new path to be able to measure nuclear fission emission from far distance. 

![Neutrino Detector in Japan](content/posts/07-13/neutrino_detector_in_japan.png)

Nuclear submarines has been a most difficult leg of the nuclear triads to eliminate to neutralize the advantage of nuclear nations. Be able to detect nuclear signature from far distance would turn the advantages of nuclear nations on its head. The nuclear engine would become a homing signal for missiles, torpedos and other weapon. 

A neutrino-based detector would be able to achieve what all modern radar and sonar can not achieve.
