### From An Apple of Knowledge To A Mexican Standoff
Why do these European countries call Eng-LAND, Switzer-LAND, Fin-LAND and Po-LAND ? And some other Central Asian countries call Turkmeni-STAN, Afghani-STAN, Uzbeki-STAN, Kyrgyz-STAN, Paki-STAN and Kazah-STAN with STAN meaning LAND in Persian. 

It is like a group of Caucasian men sitting down together in the mountain valley of Georgia in the Caucasus region after finishing the discovery of the known world and starting to re-arrange people tribes like Chess pieces into specialized regions of the World.

There is no absolute evidence that Eng-Land means the Land of Engineer but the best Engine in the World for the F22 was made in collaboration between North East American engineers and British engineers, the Nuclear Bomb was invented by British and American scientists as well as the Digital Computers.

The most leading edge and up to date Technical Knowledge from Computer, Electrical, Material, Chemical and Nuclear Engineering are in English. The French and the Korean Engineers who design and build Nuclear Reactors nowaday all speak English with their colleagues.

By recruiting and moving best Scientists and Engineers first to England and then the United States in early 1700 and teaching them a common language since early ages, the Caucasian planners can ensure the perpetual leading edge in Productivity via Engineering Innovation over other Asian powers like China and India who were holding advantages in Population counts. 

After 200 years of continuous Engineering innovation, at the beginning of 1900 with Woodrow Wilson as president of United States, two English speaking countries: US and UK, were the number one and number two economies in the world with only 160 million people total but produced 6 times the output of 900 million Indian and Chinese. The process of converting Coal and Oil into output in the Combustion Engine, West of the Caucasus was outpacing the process of converting Food and Water into output in the Human Digest System, East of the Caucasus.

And then in 1930, 10 years before World War 2, The Institute of Advanced Studies was founded in Princeton, New Jersey to host the best scientists in Mathematics, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences immigrated from Europe after the destruction of World War 1. 10 years laters, the three residents of these Advanced Institutes, John Von Newman, Albert Einstein and Oppenhimer contributed greatly to the Manhattan Project and the United States domination of world affairs after World War 2.

#### The Trinity Test and The First Attempt At Manipulating Nature at Sub Atomic Level

The detonation of the first Atom Bomb at the Trinity Test site is a major upgrade of the US Caucasian North Atlantics weapon arsenals in their expansion West toward East Asia and South toward Latin America. 

From Trinity test, the first nuclear explosion to the meeting of supreme leader Un and Donald the Duck in Hanoi, we have come a long way. A scientific discovery that has the potential turn thin air into unlimited energy has becoming the potential for a human extinction event. 

Nuclear weapon is a device that can create explosive energy from the nuclear chain reactions either through fission process - the breaking up of nuclear material or both the combination of fusion and fission process (the combining and breaking up for nuclear materials) in a thermal nuclear bomb.

Tsar Bomba is the most powerful nuclear weapon ever created and it is an example of a thermal nuclear bomb. Nuclear weapons have only been used twice by US on Japan and had little effect on the outcome of World War II but had a massive effect on the world geopolitical pictures after WWII. 

The Trinity site in New Mexico,  a very strategic location, was picked by Oppenhimer as the location for the testing of the first Atomic Bomb built under the Manhattan project. The Trinity test site is located at the intersection of the Mexican Rio Grande river and the only major flat land area connecting US Hispanic West Coast and US Caucasian East Coast through the Rocky mountain range.

From day 1, nuclear research main focus was to create a super weapon not an infinite energy source though cause it was done by British and American. Thats why Uranium-based nuclear weapon research was prioritzied over Thorium-based nuclear energy research. American and British religiously chose to expand their genetic footprints at all costs while other cultures in Africa and Asia only choose to maintain their existing genetic footprints at their natural rate. 

#### Operation Crossroads at The Bikini Atoll - First Nuclear Test On Water

After WWII, Amercica have a dominant position in the world affair as the number one economy, naval power and nuclear power. 

They conducted the first nuclear test during the Operation Crossroads at the Bikini Atoll that demonstrated the destruction of nuclear weapon on naval fleets. While land nuclear contamination is a major problem, ocean nuclear contamination is not so much. 

If a nuclear explosion happens in South China Sea or "East Sea" in Vietnamese way to call it, it is a major South East Asia and China problem but America would care less if it delivers the geo-politcal effect that they want to achieve.  So we are better off detonating a nuclear bomb in Indian Ocean if we can choose to do it. 

Russia has recenlty developed the Poseidon a nuclear autonomous torpedo that can create a radioative Tsunami. We are sure to see more naval nuclear weapon with the ability to wipe out naval fleet in near future. Any nations or pirates with access to these weapons can wipe out a carrier battle group with ease.

#### Nuclear Deterrence, Mutual Assure Destruction Doctrine and the Cold War

Nuclear detterence comes from the assumption that the defending force would be able to deter the attacking force from aggression via potential of severe nuclear destruction. It is totally irrational or MAD to initate a war between two major nuclear powers since both can achieve little rewards from such wars. It is mutually assured destruction for the USSR and US to go to war. 

Some nuclear powers like India or China with less nuclear stockpiles and the inablity to actually win in an all out nuclear exchanges with major nuclear powers like Russia and United States uses A Second Strike only policy. While Russia, US, France and England reserves their ability to Strike First in case of an imminent nuclear attacks from an adversary. 

Maybe the AK47 like the Atomic Bomb is designed by American since the US Independence Day is July 4 or 4/7 in Euro Asia. The AK47 and The Atomic Bomb are tools to ensure the strategic balance and perpetual dominant position of United States. The US and the USSR wil play Good Cop, Bad Cop in order to maintain the Dollar Hegemony as well as Western Culture and Idea Dominance. In the end both Capitalism and Communism comes from the West. US is the Good Cop and Russia is the Bad Cop.


### An Unstable Nash Equilibrium In A Multi-Polars World
#### The Collapse of Soviet Union and The Non Proliferation Treaty

After the collapse of Soviet Union in 1990s, the world balance of power is moving from a Bi-Polars into an Uni Polar with the United States becomes the dominating power. After the failed arm race, So Viet union is being pushed into a defensive position, holding on to its collaping coalitions.

#### Antimatter Energy and Its New Way To Make Bigger and Cleaner Explosion
What is the most efficient way to convert mass to energy. Current most efficient way we are using is Nuclear Fission process. However, by annihilating matter with antimatter, it is exponentially more efficient. Converting mass to energy is the equation behind every weapon as well as engine ever created by human kind.  

As a result, antimatter explosion is much larger, more efficient and do not result in nuclear fallout. 
A 10kg antimatter bomb would cause a gigantic 230 megaton explosion which is more than 4 time larger than the largest nuclear bomb Tsar that yielding 50 Megaton explosion and 1000 times larger that the Fat Man dropped on Nagasaki in 1945.

Procuding anti-matter is astronomically expensive and only possible using massive particle acclerators. However, harvesting anti-matter using Penning Trap Satelites in the Van Allen radiation belt is much more feasible.


#### The Discovery of Neutrino Oscillation and Its Ability to Wipe out Nuclear Submarines Fleet

In 2015, the discovery of neutrino oscillation by Takaaki Kajita and Arther B. McDonald has shredded light for a new path to be able to measure nuclear fission emission from far distance. 

Nuclear submarines has been a most difficult leg of the nuclear triads to eliminate to neutralize the advantage of nuclear nations. Be able to detect nuclear signature from far distance would turn the advantages of nuclear nations on its head. The nuclear engine would become a homing signal for missiles, torpedos and other weapon. 

A neutrino-based detector would be able to achieve what all modern radar and sonar can not achieve. 


#### A Multi-Planet Specie with Its Backup Plan

The "Enterprise Warp Drive" could become reality in 21 century and now it is OK to blow up earth, cause we have a backup home. 

The backup home is not for the 99.9% though, only the 0.1%.
