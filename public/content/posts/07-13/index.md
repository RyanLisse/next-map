### From An Apple of Knowledge To A Mexican Standoff

#### The Trinity Test and The Dawn of Nuclear Energy
From Trinity test, the first nuclear explosion to the meeting of supreme leader Un and Donald the Duck in Hanoi, we have come a long way. 

A scientific discovery that has the potential turn 
thin air into unlimited energy has becoming the potential for a human extinction event. 

Nuclear weapon is a device that can create explosive energy from the nuclear chain reactions either through fission process - the breaking up of nuclear material or both the combination of fusion and fission process (the combining and breaking up for nuclear materials) in a thermal nuclear bomb.

Tsar Bomba is the most powerful nuclear weapon ever created and it is an example of a thermal nuclear bomb.

Nuclear weapons have only been used twice by US on Japan and had little effect on the outcome of World War II but had a massive effect on the world geopolitical pictures after WWII. 

From day 1, nuclear research main focus was to create a super weapon not an infinite energy source though cause it was done by British and American. Thats why Uranium-based nuclear research was prioritzied over Thorium-based nuclear research. American and British naturally chose to prioritize "Individualism" over "Collectivism" cause you know why.

Nowaway, we only see Canada, India and China invest heavily in Thorium-based nuclear research. 

#### Operation Crossroads at The Bikini Atoll - First Nuclear Test On Water

After WWII, Amercica have a dominant position in the world affair as the number one economy, naval power and nuclear power. 

They conducted the first nuclear test during the Operation Crossroads at the Bikini Atoll that demonstrated the destruction of nuclear weapon on naval fleets. While land nuclear contamination is a major problem, ocean nuclear contamination is not so much. 

If a nuclear explosion happens in South China Sea or "East Sea" in Vietnamese way to call it, it is a major South East Asia and China problem but America would care less if it delivers the geo-politcal effect that they want to achieve.  So we are better off detonating a nuclear bomb in Indian Ocean if we can choose to do it. 

Russia has recenlty developed the Poseidon a nuclear autonomous torpedo that can create a radioative Tsunami. We are sure to see more naval nuclear weapon with the ability to wipe out naval fleet in near future. Any nations or pirates with access to these weapons can wipe out a carrier battle group with ease.

#### Nuclear Deterrence, Mutual Assure Destruction Doctrine and the Cold War

Nuclear detterence comes from the assumption that the defending force would be able to deter the attacking force from aggression via potential of severe nuclear destruction. It is totally irrational or MAD to initate a war between two major nuclear powers since both can achieve little rewards from such wars. It is mutually assured destruction for the USSR and US to go to war. 

Some nuclear powers like India or China with less nuclear stockpiles and the inablity to actually win in an all out nuclear exchanges with major nuclear powers like Russia and United States uses A Second Strike only policy. While Russia, US, France and England reserves their ability to Strike First in case of an imminent nuclear attacks from an adversary. 

Maybe the AK47 like the Atomic Bomb is designed by American since the US Independence Day is July 4 or 4/7 in Euro Asia. The AK47 and The Atomic Bomb are tools to ensure the strategic balance and perpetual dominant position of United States. The US and the USSR wil play Good Cop, Bad Cop in order to maintain the Dollar Hegemony as well as Western Culture and Idea Dominance. In the end both Capitalism and Communism comes from the West. US is the Good Cop and Russia is the Bad Cop.


### An Unstable Nash Equilibrium In A Multi-Polars World
#### The Collapse of Soviet Union and The Non Proliferation Treaty

After the collapse of Soviet Union in 1990s, the world balance of power is moving from a Bi-Polars into an Uni Polar with the United States becomes the dominating power. After the failed arm race, So Viet union is being pushed into a defensive position, holding on to its collaping coalitions.

#### Antimatter Energy and Its New Way To Make Bigger and Cleaner Explosion
What is the most efficient way to convert mass to energy. Current most efficient way we are using is Nuclear Fission process. However, by annihilating matter with antimatter, it is exponentially more efficient. Converting mass to energy is the equation behind every weapon as well as engine ever created by human kind.  

As a result, antimatter explosion is much larger, more efficient and do not result in nuclear fallout. 
A 10kg antimatter bomb would cause a gigantic 230 megaton explosion which is more than 4 time larger than the largest nuclear bomb Tsar that yielding 50 Megaton explosion and 1000 times larger that the Fat Man dropped on Nagasaki in 1945.

Procuding anti-matter is astronomically expensive and only possible using massive particle acclerators. However, harvesting anti-matter using Penning Trap Satelites in the Van Allen radiation belt is much more feasible.


#### The Discovery of Neutrino Oscillation and Its Ability to Wipe out Nuclear Submarines Fleet

In 2015, the discovery of neutrino oscillation by Takaaki Kajita and Arther B. McDonald has shredded light for a new path to be able to measure nuclear fission emission from far distance. 

Nuclear submarines has been a most difficult leg of the nuclear triads to eliminate to neutralize the advantage of nuclear nations. Be able to detect nuclear signature from far distance would turn the advantages of nuclear nations on its head. The nuclear engine would become a homing signal for missiles, torpedos and other weapon. 

A neutrino-based detector would be able to achieve what all modern radar and sonar can not achieve. 


#### A Multi-Planet Specie with Its Backup Plan

The "Enterprise Warp Drive" could become reality in 21 century and now it is OK to blow up earth, cause we have a backup home. 

The backup home is not for the 99.9% though, only the 0.1%.
