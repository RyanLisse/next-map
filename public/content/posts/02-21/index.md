### Politics is Temporary, Genetics and Geography is Permanent
What would you do if you can travel anywhere on earth within a week and possess personal arms advanced enough to deal with any potential threats on your journey with little risk of death and injuries to your crews. 

At the beginning of 1900, the Western world already mastered ocean fairing and air travel with the inventions of the combustion engines.

Since humans are land animals with advanced organization skills, if a crew from Europe traveled on land into a highly populated area of a foreign tribe, they would risk triggering a hostile response from the local tribes when the tribes suddenly met a group of strangely looking foreigners. Even with modern guns, if they are outnumbered or caught in an ambush, there is nothing to ensure their safety. 

However with planes and the iron ships, the European power can keep a distance, maneuver and take advantage of their saturating fire power. 

Probably after finishing the drawing of the World Map and collecting terrains and population data of the earth civilization with planes, steam vessels and cars, the West realized how outnumbered but more advanced they are to the other civilizations around the globe. 

By moving core leadership components behind nature barriers like mountains and ocean, the more advanced civilizations of the West can rely on their air powers and sea powers to deal with the hordes of land-based East Asian and Indian civilization ambitions. 

And after completing the colonization of North America and migrating VIP European lineages to the uncrossable via land castle of North America by 1900, the Western civilization can start to switch from defensive plans to offensive plans by transforming the genetic makeup of Euro Asia. 

At the time when most of the earth surfaces were still empty with no major road networks and borders between neighboring kingdoms were not drawn, European colonial powers with their long-range mobility via the combustion engine vehicles running on fossil fuels can divide redrawn the chessboard of earth surfaces to put enemy tribes into conflicts and their supporters behind major geographical anchors like in the case of Kazahstan and Japan.
