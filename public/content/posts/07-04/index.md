### Investing in Arrows is better than investing in Shields
From the Qin crossbow that puts firepower in the hands of normal, not well trained farmers to the AK47 in Vietnam war to the Manpad Stingray in the Afghan war, history rewards leaders who can empower their common people with the ability to defend themselves and their interests. 

In the battle for Ukraine, this once again prove to be true with the successful of the Javelin, a portable anti-tank missiles that enable a small country like Ukraine to take out one third of all Russian tanks available for combat.

### Stealth Technology - An Over-Valued Weapon or an Investment Trap
Stealth technlogy over-valuation is leading to over-investing and over-estimating the technology effectiveness. Limited numbers of stealth planes available for combat and the loss of one plane is leading to the loss of a huge part of offensive powers.

### Near Future Technology Can Lead To The House Of Card's Total Collapse
Machine learning will help to filter out the noise in radar return in L-Band radar which eventually enable the detection of F35s, F22s and other stealth planes and ships.

Quantum radar will exponentially change the game and enable detecting, locating, tracking and targeting at great distance hyper accurately.

Improvement in machine vision technology and autonomous driving will enable missle homing using visual signature instead of heat or radio-based signature. While stealth airframe is optimized to reduce infrared and radar signature, it is still a huge aircraft that is visible to the naked eyes.
