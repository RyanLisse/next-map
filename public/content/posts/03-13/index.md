## The Physics of Flying Projectiles
![Chimpanzee throwing rocks](content/posts/03-13/early_human.png)

***Human body structure*** allows us to be the only animal in the planet to be able throw a projectile that could reach the speed of ***180 km/h***. 

Among all animals, only human were be able to turn other objects around us into tools and weapons instead of using our own body parts as weapon like in the case of dogs, cats, tigers or sharks. 

Probably after for the first time a human were able to fench off a pack of wolfs by throwing couple rocks that he started to become obsessive at making better tools to enable him to win in the harsh genetic competition of nature and gradually become the apex predators of the planet. 

By accelerating a heavy projectile using ***his momentum*** and ***the body torques***, an average human can produce a much stronger force than the simple push and pull actions using his own arms, fists or legs.

By throwing rocks and later on the javelins, early human were able to hunt big animals many time larger than his size while ***keeping a distance to stay out of range*** from the sharp teeths, claws and horns of the animals.

Since that time that an ancient human tribe were able to hunt a big elephant, the human society keep inventing new methods in order to accelerate projectiles increasing faster and further to produce forces at the point of impact multiple times stronger than the maximum output of his muscles. 

Instead of using just our shoulders as ***the spring***, we start to turn trees and ropes into the springs with the invention of the bow. With the bow spring, an arrow can travel up to ***240 km/h*** and can ***penetrate through animal tissues and bones***. Bow is ***much lighter*** and ***more acccurate*** than rocks and javelins and can fire off large number of arrows.

With the bow, the Mongolian average men were able to live off the foreign land they travel to via hunting as well as fending off any hostile tribes on their path from a distance. The bow is the true force multiplier that allow one to fight many. 

By increasing *the weight of the arrow* and the force of the spring via ***incremental loading*** rather than single load like throwing or shooting arrow, the Roman ballista can even penerate through wooden structures like boats or shield.

Taking incremental loading and heavy projectile to another level by leveraging gravity, the man-made war tool of trebuchet were able to penetrate through stone castle walls and doors using both ***forward forces of the springs*** and the ***downward force*** of the projectile weight. With the trebuchet, the Mongol were able to take down heavily fortified castles of the Song dynasty and foreverly change the genetics make up of China.

And then in the distant past in China, an emperor assigned a top secret task to his imperial medics of making a longevity pill that could extend life. After years of labor, the imperial medics figured out that the task was impossible but if they said no to the powerful emperor they would be executed. 

By passing down power to the next princes, accepting death as the inevitable part of life, and direct national resources behind infrastructures and military projects, the emperor's DNA would live on for many hundred years with his sons and grandkids. However, if the imperial medics said no to the emperor's grandiose plan of living forever, they would be executed. 

So the disgruntled medics decided to make a fake longevity pill by mixing fire match powder with charcoal and fertilizers to poison the emperor slowly. That way the powerful emperor would die before he could execute his imperial medics. The faked longevity pills did not help the powerful emperor to live forever but accidentally caused a massive explosion while in storage. 

![The Gunpowder](content/posts/03-13/gunpowder_maybe_formula.png)

The Chinese imperial medics who were tasked with extending lifes just discovered a powerful new weapon that would cause much more death than any previous centuries but still massively increase human population at the same time, the firework powder. Firework powder or gunpowder turn humans into such a powerful and efficient predator that ***if a dinosaur were to be resurrected, it would still have to accept the same fate as a wet market chicken.***  

With enough gun powder and a massive cannon ball, a direct hit from a gun cannon can take down thick city walls much more rapidly and accurately than the trebuchet without the need to rely on the free gravity acceleration of ***32.4 km/h***. A gunpowder explosion can accelerate a projectile quickly to more than ***6000 km/h*** and the cannon could be aimed directly at the castle door or walls. 

With a largest gunpowder cannon every built, the Ottoman Empire were able to capture Constantinople, modern day Instabul, Turkey and end the last of the surviving Roman Empire. With the fall of Constantinople, the genetics makeup of Europe also changed forever with Central and Eastern European being much more Turk genetically.
