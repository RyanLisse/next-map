## The Physics of Flying Projectiles
![Chimpanzee throwing rocks](content/posts/03-13/early_human.png)

***Human body structure*** allows us to be the only animal in the planet to be able throw a projectile that could reach the speed of ***180 km/h***. 

Among all animals, only human were be able to turn other objects around us into tools and weapons instead of using our own body parts as weapon like in the case of dogs, cats, tigers or sharks. 

Probably after for the first time a human were able to fench off a pack of wolfs by throwing couple rocks that he started to become obsessive at making better tools to enable him to win in the harsh genetic competition of nature and gradually become the apex predators of the planet. 

By accelerating a heavy projectile using ***his momentum*** and ***the body torques***, an average human can produce a much stronger force than the simple push and pull actions using his own arms, fists or legs.

By throwing rocks and later on the javelins, early human were able to hunt big animals many time larger than his size while ***keeping a distance to stay out of range*** from the sharp teeths, claws and horns of the animals. 

![Hunting Mammoth](content/posts/03-13/hunting_mamooth.png)

Since that time that an ancient human tribe were able to hunt a big elephant, the human society keep inventing new methods in order to accelerate projectiles increasing faster and further to produce forces at the point of impact multiple times stronger than the maximum output of his muscles. 

Instead of using just our shoulders as ***the spring***, we start to turn trees and ropes into the springs with the invention of the bow. With the bow spring, an arrow can travel up to ***240 km/h*** and can ***penetrate through animal tissues and bones***. Bow is ***much lighter*** and ***more acccurate*** than rocks and javelins and can fire off large number of arrows. 

![The Mongol Bow](content/posts/03-13/mongol_bow.png)

With the bow, the Mongolian average men were able to live off the foreign land they travel to via hunting as well as fending off any hostile tribes on their path from a distance. The bow is the true force multiplier that allow one to fight many. 

By increasing *the weight of the arrow* and the force of the spring via ***incremental loading*** rather than single load like throwing or shooting arrow, the Roman ballista can even penerate through wooden structures like boats or shield.

![The Roman Ballista](content/posts/03-13/ballista_large_arrow_incremental_load.png)

Taking incremental loading and heavy projectile to another level by leveraging gravity, the man-made war tool of trebuchet were able to penetrate through stone castle walls and doors using both ***forward forces of the springs*** and the ***downward force*** of the projectile weight. With the trebuchet, the Mongol were able to take down heavily fortified castles of the Song dynasty and foreverly change the genetics make up of China.

And then in the distant past in China, an emperor assigned a top secret task to his imperial medics of making a longevity pill that could extend life. After years of labor, the imperial medics figured out that the task was impossible but if they said no to the powerful emperor they would be executed. 

By passing down power to the next princes, accepting death as the inevitable part of life, and direct national resources behind infrastructures and military projects, the emperor's DNA would live on for many hundred years with his sons and grandkids. However, if the imperial medics said no to the emperor's grandiose plan of living forever, they would be executed. 

So the disgruntled medics decided to make a fake longevity pill by mixing fire match powder with charcoal and fertilizers to poison the emperor slowly. That way the powerful emperor would die before he could execute his imperial medics. The faked longevity pills did not help the powerful emperor to live forever but accidentally caused a massive explosion while in storage. 

![The Gunpowder](content/posts/03-13/gunpowder_maybe_formula.png)

The Chinese imperial medics who were tasked with extending lifes just discovered a powerful new weapon that would cause much more death than any previous centuries but still massively increase human population at the same time, the firework powder. Firework powder or gunpowder turn humans into such a powerful and efficient predator that ***if a dinosaur were to be resurrected, it would still have to accept the same fate as a wet market chicken.***  

With enough gun powder and a massive cannon ball, a direct hit from a gun cannon can take down thick city walls much more rapidly and accurately than the trebuchet without the need to rely on the free gravity acceleration of ***32.4 km/h***. A gunpowder explosion can accelerate a projectile quickly to more than ***6000 km/h*** and the cannon could be aimed directly at the castle door or walls. 

With a largest gunpowder cannon every built, the Ottoman Empire were able to capture Constantinople, modern day Instabul, Turkey and end the last of the surviving Roman Empire. With the fall of Constantinople, the genetics makeup of Europe also changed forever with Central and Eastern European being much more Turk genetically.

![The Ottoman Canon](content/posts/03-13/turk_canon.png)

The founder of Constantinople and the first Christian emperor of Rome, Constantine realized that his superior navy and the Roman shield walls would not do well in the flat open field terrain of Germany and Ukraine against the cavalry and horse archers from the East.  

So Constantine moved the capital of the Roman Empire to a naval stroke point at the mouth of the Black Sea to maximize Roman Empire naval advantages and their shield wall tactics just like modern day Singapore. 

However with gunpowder and the cannon, the Eastern Roman naval boats and their shield wall are no longer effective. The Roman wooden boats and their wooden shields could easily be penetrated by the projectiles accelerated via gunpowder that the Ottoman Turk bought from China via the ancient Silk Road. Even the thick castle wall made of rock could also be breached with a large cannonball, enough gunpowder and a long gun barrel to accelerate the cannonball. 

A massive explosion that took down the hundred years wall of Constantinople finally woke up the Christian kingdoms of Western Europe from their long Dark age and kick started the Gunpowder arm race in Europe and the naval trades with the Far East of India and China. 

The Christian planners determined to never fall behind in war innovation again and also started to look for a better geographical location for their new capital in the West and accidentally found the American continent.

## Artilery Roles in Past Warfare

#### The Archor Formation
Making an effective bow is an art that requires a high level of attention to details. To become an effective archer requires years of training and is not as straightforward as throwing a rock, swinging a sword or thrusting a long sharp pipe forward. 

The first full time standing division of the ancient armies is probably the archer formation. While the foot infantry could be recruited from the farmer population and be armed and trained quickly for a few months before a major campaign,  the archers need to be trained from early teenagers and probably come from military or noble families. 

Being able to aim and shoot an arrow while standing in one position at a stationary target accurately would require at least one year of training. 

Being able to aim and shoot an arrow at a moving target accurately under the extreme stress of the battlefield would require many years of training. 

And being able to aim and shoot while riding a horse at many moving targets in a few minutes would require decades of training since childhood. 

East Asian cultures since ancient times have always had a higher level of attention to details  and are more diligent at practicing their skills than other Western cultures. 

As a result Eastern Asian cultures produced many more effective archers than in the West. To the modern day, East Asians still excel and outperform Western counterparts at other human domains that require a high level of attention to detail and diligent practice like semiconductor manufacturing, software engineering, musical instruments or plastic surgeries.

To be able to produce a large number of effective archers though was very difficult and the archers are reserved to produce the initial shock during open battle or protecting the core leadership component from the city walls. Wars in the East were still decided mainly by the foot infantry until the appearance of the Mongols. 

The Mongols' culture and way of life were able to turn the art of archery into a standardized skill, turn every common man and even woman into effective archers, and as a result produced a shocking amount of horse archers and dominated both East Asia and Eastern Europe. 

#### The Rapid Innovation in Fire Powder, Gun Barrel and the Reload Mechanism in the West

The American and Swiss turned handgun shooting into a standardized skill. So no countries ever conquered the US or Switzerland. Gun violence is still a big problem in the US though but the actual casualty statistics from gun violence is still much lower than eating fast food or car accidents.
