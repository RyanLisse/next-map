### Egyptian and the Way Out from Slavery With Moses

Moses was the leader of the Israaelites, an enslaved minority working under the Egyptian Pharaoh building his pyramids and other megastructure projects. 

The Pharaoh need more smart slaves like the Hebrew to be able to finish his megastructure projects faster but when there are too many of them then their numbers might result in disobedience and even a revolution. The guards build nothing and consumer more resources than the slaves so it does not make sense to have too many guards either. 

To limit the strength of the slaves within Egyptian empire, the Pharah ordered all new born Hebrew boys to be killed in order to assimilate the Hebrew into the Egyptian identity, to make the Hebrew looking more like the Egyptian. 

People have the tendency to comply and follow the people who look like them in the pre-tele-vision era. Most animals do not attack or eat their kinds. Allying with the people who look like you is a natural evolutionary tendency of most animals. 

By reducing the number of Hebrew baby boys and inter-married between the Egyptian and the Hebrew, the Pharaoh would make few Hebrew leaders looking more like them and be able to use them as middle managers to direct the Hebrew slave population. 

One theory is that after the Pyramids were finished, Moses, an Egyptian-Israelite mixed boy, led the unemployed slaves away from the Niles through the deserts to a dry mountain called Mount Sinai to die so they are no longer a threat to the Egyptian empire. 

Modern infantry training is 40 km a day running. So a trip from Giza to Mount Sinai of 463 km would take at least 12 days or more. They are marching with women, children and the elderly so it probably will take much longer and they are marching away from water sources to a dry mountain with no water.

Another theory is that Moses marched his followers from one isolated settlement to others with water supply and food to recruit more followers into one single strong force. They marched from Giza to Sinai and came back as an snowballed army to the Pyramids of Giza to take on the Pharaohs and his guards. 

People would join them along the way, weaker elders and childrens would die and by the time they got to Mount Sinai, only stronger men, women and older children would survive. They would be fit for services, free of dependents and ready to take the Pyramid of Giza. 

That is kind of what happened in the Egyptian myth where Moses marched to Mount Sinai and came back with God 10 commandments, rain hells down to Giza, and liberate the Egyptian slaves. Moses drafted his army by walking from one small community of free Israelites in the desert to the others with the escaped Israelite slaves. The group kept getting larger and stronger by the time they get back to Giza, they would be a stronger fighting force than the Egyptian army. 

One thing for sure is that no one can not build a nation from Mount Sinai and they need to come back to the Nile.
