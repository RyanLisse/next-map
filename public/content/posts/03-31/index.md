### Christianity and Its Lack of Adoption in The East
![Communism](content/posts/03-31/reinvention_of_god.png)

While Christianity and its various variants were quickly adopted by European tribes in England, Scandinavia and Eastern Europe who lacked sophisticated rituals, architectural monuments and government structures, Christianity met heavy resistance among East Asian civilizations.

Even after The West had conquered Beijing,  the apex of East Asian culture expression, during the Boxer rebellion in 1899 with the cutting edge firearm and ship building technology, the Christian missionaries were still not able to convert Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese or Thai into Christianity. 

At the beginning of the 1900s, East Asian culture was too sophisticated and different with their own unique fortified castles, religious temples, military and social structures. There are not enough bullets or trained army personnels for the sheer amount of East Asian population. If the West can not subdue the minds of these Far East people with religion, they can not make the East Asian population become an obedient worker ants population. 

The bible and the bishopâ€™s stories about some distant desert and resurrection did not appeal to East Asian commoners who already had their ritual teachers and heard plenty of highly scripted stories about ghost, fairy and supernatural phenomenons. 

The high priests of the Swiss Alps need to invent a new story that is more appealing to all the common man and women across cultures outside of Europe and the Mediterrians. The stories need to be able to erase all cultures, social and government structures of the Eastern civilizations and rebuild it with Western thoughts and influences.Hence Capitalism, Facism and Communism just like Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox was invented and Lenin was sent to the Kremlin with a new script to forever change the societies in Central and East Asia.

East Asian societies trade for good with currencies, build armies for war and organize large worker groups to build castles and cannals long before the invention of Capitalism, Facism and Communism. However, these new Western thoughts and their own bibles, somehow direct East Asian societies to destroy their own cultures, religious temples and castles and become extremely dependent on Western technology, firearms and medicine. That is why the Kremlin, meaning fortress in Russian, is still standing to the modern day while the 10,000s kilometer Great Walls of China were reduced to less than 100 kilometers and Vietnam capital Thang Long walls no longer exist.
