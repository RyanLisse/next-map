## Buddhism and The Flows of Nature

### The Creation of the Universe, the Sun, Earth, Water and Life Form

At the beginning of the Universe, there is the Big Bang, a massive explosion that scratter energies in all 360 degree directions. Where the energy releases were too strong, it punched holes through the fabric of known space and created the voids, black holes of energy leakage. Energies that do not leak out of known space,  combined randomly during the first few milliseconds of chaotic expansion formed chemical elements.

Random chemical elements continue to expand rapidly at near speed of light to form trillion of large hot balls of chemical mess. Among the trillion hot chemical balls, only the purest balls containing mostly only Hydrogen, the simplest element of the Periodic table, were able to kick start the nuclear fusion cycle. The nuclear fusion cycle stops the random scattering of elements, combining Hydrogen into an increasingly larger mass. When the Hydrogen ball got large enough, it created space traction, slowed down energy leakage toward the blackholes and attracted surrounding planets to form its Solar system. 

Among millions of solar systems, there is our solar system with a random planet that cools down to the right temperature and has the right un-pured combination of Hydrogen, Oxygen and Carbon to form waters and complex life forms. Water is essential for all biological forms on earth. It is the catalyst for all biochemical processes that create complex Carbon-based compounds that form cells, tissues and muscles. The abundance of water is the deciding factor behind the abundances of life. Where there is plenty of water then there is a massive number of  humans, animals and plants while where there is water scarcity then life is difficult and it is always a struggle for all biological life forms.
