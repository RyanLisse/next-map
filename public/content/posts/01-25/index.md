## Buddhism and The Flows of Nature

### The Creation of the Universe, the Sun, Earth, Water and Life Form

At the beginning of the Universe, there is the Big Bang, a massive explosion that scatters energies in all 360 degree directions. Where the energy releases were too strong, it punched holes through the fabric of known space and created the voids, black holes of energy leakage. Energies that do not leak out of known space,  combined randomly during the first few milliseconds of chaotic expansion formed chemical elements. 

![The Multiverse Model](/content/posts/01-25/the_universe.png)

Random chemical elements continue to expand rapidly at near speed of light to form trillion of large hot balls of chemical mess. Among the trillion hot chemical balls, only the purest balls containing mostly only Hydrogen, the simplest element of the Periodic table, were able to kick start the nuclear fusion cycle. The nuclear fusion cycle stops the random scattering of elements, combining Hydrogen into an increasingly larger mass. When the Hydrogen ball got large enough, it created space traction, slowed down energy leakage toward the blackholes and attracted surrounding planets to form its Solar system.

Among millions of solar systems, there is our solar system with a random planet that cools down to the right temperature and has the right un-pured combination of  Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen and Carbon to form air, water, and complex life forms.  Water is essential for all biological forms on earth. It is the catalyst for all biochemical processes that create complex Carbon-based compounds that form cells, tissues and muscles. The abundance of water is the deciding factor behind the abundances of life. Where there is plenty of water then there is a massive number of  humans, animals and plants while where there is water scarcity then life is difficult and it is always a struggle for all biological life forms. 

### Rivers, the natural channels for religions and genetic influences

Earth at first was a calm water ball with little wind or weather system. After the initial cooling down of earth surfaces, the earth core is still a hot ball of constant  nuclear fission explosions. These constant expansion and contraction of the earth core causes the earth's surface plates to move around, collide against each other forming mountains, continents and deep ocean. The different elevation in earth surfaces cause the uneven heat distribution among earth's surface. Air starts to move from high pressure colder regions of the earth to low pressure hotter regions of the earth. 

So during the day, we have the wind blowing from colder ocean to hotter land and at night we have the wind blowing from colder land toward hotter ocean. Because the earth core is also not perfectly distributed, the earth tilts by 23 degrees which causes the hottest regions on earth to move up and down across the equator throughout 365 rotation of the earth. Because of the seasonal effect of our weather, wind blowing over the massive body of ocean water could become extremely strong and form high wind tropical storms. The category 5 wind could push the massive storms full of water deep inside continental cells and only stop by the high mountains of the Himalaya. 

![Mountain Stops the Rainy Clouds](/content/posts/01-25/mountain.png)

All rivers in Pakistan, India, South East Asia and China were formed through the massive dump of water from tropical clouds at the top of the Him-Ala-Ya. Right above Him-Ala-Ya is the Tibetan plateau, a flat highland of thousand calm lakes. Waters and the people here do not experience the constant changes of lower lands and coaster regions but rather absolutely still like the Meditation experience. 

![Tibetan Highland Map](/content/posts/01-25/monsoon_02.png)

Tibetan was the birthplace of Buddhism which later on evolved into Indian version of Hinduism, Khmer Buddhism and Japanese-Chinese Buddhism.  

![Lhasa, Tibet](/content/posts/01-25/lhasa_tibet.png)

Before the age of the global position system and detailed printed map, you could easily get lost and die when you venture too far away from your birthplace. The benefit of cross-region travel is only available to the kings and generals with their hundred helpers. 

The natural way to navigate across the landmass of Asia is downstream through the river banks. The monks of the Tibetan plateau with their high elevation stamina could walk for thousands of miles across from one river settlement to others. Through their journey across the human settlements along the Indus river, Brahmaputra River, the Mekong River, the Yangtze River and the Yellow Rivers, they would encounter different languages and cultures. 

In order to gain trust and learn the local languages, they will need to develop a phonetic writing system to memorize the pronunciation of local languages, spread their teaching in local languages and make their mark on stones in the newly developed Script. 

![Iraq Buddha Mark](/content/posts/01-25/iraq_buddha_mark.png)

So nowadays, we could find the Buddha mark from Iraq to Japan. The Tibetan monks or the Soviet Union Kazah builders got to Iraq by traversing the Indus river then following the coast of Iran to Iraq. They then build the Buddha statues by carving out a mountain to mark their voyage as well as a way to store the knowledges about the locals for the next explorers. 

![Iraq Buddha Mark](/content/posts/01-25/iraq_buddha_from_a_far.png)

The Tibetan monks or the So Viet explorers also traversed the Brahmaputra River to modern day Bangladesh then sailed along the Indian West coast to Sri Lanka. Nowaday, we can still find the strong Buddhist influences in Sri Lanka as well as the famous Buddha tooth relic.

![Sri Lanka Buddha Tooth](/content/posts/01-25/Sri_Lanka_Buddha_Tooth.png)

The Tibetan monks probably traveled down the Mekong river through Laos, North East Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam Mekong delta region and built temples along their travel paths as a way to get resupplied by the local workshippers. Modern day Thai, Lao and Cambodian buddhism seems to all developed out of the original Khmer Buddism with similar Hat-like roof architecture. 

![Khmer Buddism](/content/posts/01-25/khmer_buddism.png)

While the Vietnamese and Yunnan Chinese Buddhist temples have the Pole-like shape. These Pole-like shapes and the female-only Buddhist worshiping custom shows the competing influences of Buddhism and Taoism in South West China and Vietnam and the genetic mixing of  Taoism and Buddhism worshippers as well as architecture.  

![Yunnam Vietnam Buddism](/content/posts/01-25/pole_buddism_temple.png)

And the Chinese - Japanese Buddhist temples look totally Taoism with little resemblance to Tibetan architecture. The extremely long trip down the Yangtze river toward Japan probably could not be done by a large party of Buddhist monks and only few make it all the way to Japan to spread their teaching. However, the local kings and warlords of China, Korea, Japan and Taiwan still seem to be big admirers of Buddhism and built their large temples with the local architecture for them.

![Confucius Buddism](/content/posts/01-25/japan_korean_taiwan_china.png)

There could be the Salt-trade between Tibetan regions and the lower stream to sustain the religious trips of monks and their workshippers up and down the major rivers. The buddhist monks did not seem to be long sea voyagers so we do not find their mark outside of major river systems in the islands of Indonesia, Australia or the American continents but only in coastal islands like Sri Lanka, Singapore, Taiwan and Japan. 

### The making of Thai water reservoirs and its own branch of Buddhism
![Thai Rivers and Settlements](/content/posts/01-25/thai_river_settlements.png)

In 1930, at the beginning of the American Great Depression, the Hoover Dam, the largest Lake of Lights in the world was built in the Colorado river of the United States. The Hoover Dam, the world largest Hydroelectric Dam and Water Reservoir, turns the natural downstream gravitational force of the Colorado river into aggregation channels and electricity that feed and power millions of homes in California, Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico states. 

![The Hoover Dam](/content/posts/01-25/hoover_dam.png)

The Hoover Dam also serves as the population regulation device for the surrounding area and the last resort military defensive device. 

After the rise of Japan in the East and its victorious Naval war against Russia in Siberia during WW1, the need to regulate the population growth of East Asian descendants in the US West Coast is increasingly more urgent. 

After the construction of the Hoover Dam, the agriculture production of the US West Coast as well as its population could be limited. At the same time, the agriculture production of Mexico in the South slowly declined and more Mexicans started to migrate to California and Texas, renounced their Mexican citizenship, became American citizens and swore to protect the American constitution and the American father land. 

California cities of Lights and Television stars draw increasingly more Mexicans away from their dark desert homeland to Los Angeles Movie Capital and San Francisco High Tech Capital. 

While the Mexican could be easily programmed by Christianity, the Japanese intelligence and Chinese massive population and their attachment to Taoism is a big threat to the American growth in power and wealth. 

If there is ever a naval amphibious landing in California and invasions of the US mainland in the West, the Hoover Dam could be used as a water bomb to stop the advances of the invading Asian armies. 

The hedging of Asian powerhouses’ military and economic growth turns out to be not necessary after WW2. The Qing dynasty totally collapsed, the Chinese suffered the largest casualty in World WW2 and Japan was bombarded with two atomic bombs and their emperor had to offer unconditional surrender to the American and Russian forces.  

After the great calamities of World War 2 of death and darkness, the gods of SouthEast Asia were sent home from the West to bring light to their people. 

In Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh, whose name means the Lake of Light, returned from Russia and became the president of Vietnam. And In Thailand, King of Rama X, born in Boston, US and educated in Switzerland,  became the King of Thailand. 

Ho Chi Minh brought knowledge and enlightenment to every Vietnamese by teaching everyone how to read and write in the Latin alphabet. 

![Chu Quoc Ngu](/content/posts/01-25/chu_quoc_ngu.png)

Thai and their Buddhist King Bhumibol built Asia largest and first Lake of Light in 1964, the Bhumibol Hydroelectric Dam. 

![Thai Water Reservoirs](/content/posts/01-25/thailand_dams.png)

The Bhumibol water reservoirs and six other water reservoirs in the North and South West regions of Thailand offered food, water and energy security for the growth of Thai population while their neighbor in the East, Vietnam experienced constant bombardments and wars from 1945 to 1990. The Bhumibol Dam could also be the last resort military defensive water bomb from any Burmese invading armies from the West just like the Hoover Dam.
