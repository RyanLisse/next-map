## Buddhism and The Flows of Nature

### The Creation of the Universe, the Sun, Earth, Water and Life Form

At the beginning of the Universe, there is the Big Bang, a massive explosion that scatters energies in all 360 degree directions. Where the energy releases were too strong, it punched holes through the fabric of known space and created the voids, black holes of energy leakage. Energies that do not leak out of known space,  combined randomly during the first few milliseconds of chaotic expansion formed chemical elements.

Random chemical elements continue to expand rapidly at near speed of light to form trillion of large hot balls of chemical mess. Among the trillion hot chemical balls, only the purest balls containing mostly only Hydrogen, the simplest element of the Periodic table, were able to kick start the nuclear fusion cycle. The nuclear fusion cycle stops the random scattering of elements, combining Hydrogen into an increasingly larger mass. When the Hydrogen ball got large enough, it created space traction, slowed down energy leakage toward the blackholes and attracted surrounding planets to form its Solar system.

Among millions of solar systems, there is our solar system with a random planet that cools down to the right temperature and has the right un-pured combination of Hydrogen, Oxygen and Carbon to form waters and complex life forms. Water is essential for all biological forms on earth. It is the catalyst for all biochemical processes that create complex Carbon-based compounds that form cells, tissues and muscles. The abundance of water is the deciding factor behind the abundances of life. Where there is plenty of water then there is a massive number of  humans, animals and plants while where there is water scarcity then life is difficult and it is always a struggle for all biological life forms. 

### Rivers, the natural channels for religions and genetic influences ?

Earth at first was a calm water ball with little wind or weather system. After the initial cooling down of earth surfaces, the earth core is still a hot ball of constant  nuclear fission explosions. These constant expansion and contraction of the earth core causes the earth's surface plates to move around, collide against each other forming mountains, continents and deep ocean. The different elevation in earth surfaces cause the uneven heat distribution among earth's surface. Air starts to move from high pressure colder regions of the earth to low pressure hotter regions of the earth. 

So during the day, we have the wind blowing from colder ocean to hotter land and at night we have the wind blowing from colder land toward hotter ocean. Because the earth core is also not perfectly distributed, the earth tilts by 23 degrees which causes the hottest regions on earth to move up and down across the equator throughout 365 rotation of the earth. Because of the seasonal effect of our weather, wind blowing over the massive body of ocean water could become extremely strong and form high wind tropical storms. The category 5 wind could push the massive storms full of water deep inside continental cells and only stop by the high mountains of the Himalaya.

All rivers in Pakistan, India, South East Asia and China were formed through the massive dump of water from tropical clouds at the top of the Him-Ala-Ya. Right above Him-Ala-Ya is the Tibetan plateau, a flat highland of thousand calm lakes. Waters and the people here do not experience the constant changes of lower lands and coaster regions but rather absolutely still like the Meditation experience.

Tibetan was the birthplace of Buddhism which later on evolved into Indian version of Hinduism, Khmer Buddhism and Japanese-Chinese Buddhism.

Before the age of the global position system and detailed printed map, you could easily get lost and die when you venture too far away from your birthplace. The benefit of cross-region travel is only available to the kings and generals with their hundred helpers. 

The natural way to navigate across the landmass of Asia is downstream through the river banks. The monks of the Tibetan plateau with their high elevation stamina could walk for thousands of miles across from one river settlement to others. Through their journey across the human settlements along the Indus river, Brahmaputra River, the Mekong River, the Yangtze River and the Yellow Rivers, they would encounter different languages and cultures. 

In order to gain trust and learn the local languages, they will need to develop a phonetic writing system to memorize the pronunciation of local languages, spread their teaching in local languages and make their mark on stones in the newly developed Script.

So nowadays, we could find the Buddha mark from Iraq to Japan. The Tibetan monks or the Soviet Union Kazah builders got to Iraq by traversing the Indus river then following the coast of Iran to Iraq. They then build the Buddha statues by carving out a mountain to mark their voyage as well as a way to store the knowledges about the locals for the next explorers. 

![Iraq Buddha Mark](/content/posts/01-25/iraq_buddha_from_a_far.png)

The Tibetan monks or the So Viet explorers also traversed the Brahmaputra River to modern day Bangladesh then sailed along the Indian West coast to Sri Lanka. Nowaday, we can still find the strong Buddhist influences in Sri Lanka as well as the famous Buddha tooth relic.

The Tibetan monks probably traveled downt the Mekong river through Laos, North East Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam Mekong delta region and built temples along their travel paths as a way to get resupplied by the local workshippers. Modern day Thai, Lao and Cambodian buddhism seems to all developed out of the original Khmer Buddism with similar Hat-like roof architecture. 

![Khmer Buddism](/content/posts/01-25/khmer_buddism.png)

While the Vietnamese and Yunnan Chinese Buddism temples have the Pole-like shape. These Pole-like shape and the female-only Buddism workshiping custom shows the completing influences of Buddism and Confucism in South West China and Vietnam and the genetics mixing of Confucism and Buddism workshippers as well as architectures.  

![Yunnam Vietnam Buddism](/content/posts/01-25/pole_buddism_temple.png)

And the Chinese-Japanese Buddism temples look totally Confucism with little resemble to Tibetan architecture. The extremely long trip down the Yangzte river toward Japan probably could not be done by a large party of Buddism monks and only few make it all the way to Japan to spread their teaching. However, the local kings and warlords of China, Korea, Japan and Taiwan still seem to be big admirers of Buddism and built their large temples with the local architecture for them.

![Confucius Buddism](/content/posts/01-25/japan_korean_taiwan_china.png)

There could be the Salt-trade between Tibetan regions and the lower stream to sustain the religious trips of monks and their workshippers up and down the major rivers. The buddhist monks did not seem to be long sea voyagers so we do not find their mark outside of major river systems in the islands of Indonesia, Australia or the American continents but only in coastal islands like Sri Lanka, Singapore, Taiwan and Japan.
