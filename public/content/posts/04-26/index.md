### Mongol and A World of City States Without Border
Before human civilizations were able to raise horses in large numbers, a common man was only able to venture a few kilometers away from his settlements and his water sources. When humans started to develop farming techniques, our civilizations became even more 
concentrated around major water sources. 

While trees could grow their roots deep underground for water sources and bird could spot lakes and river kilometers away and fly for hundred of kilometers non stop, farming society even with the wheels only can develop settlements 100 - 200 square kilometers in size and few become wealthy enough to maintain a large army and build fortified castles and walls around its administrative body. There was not a national border line and clashes happened regularly at the middle points between two major rival settlements. 

While the modern ground vehicles need to travel on paved roads, the horses are all terrain vehicles that could travel on almost all earth surfaces and allows the mounted archers and calvaries to maneuver around unguarded empty lands between major human settlements.

Maybe this is the reason why Moscow and Beijing were both built faraway from nearby water sources and were two tributary city states to the Western Mongol of Golden Hordes and the Eastern Mongol of Yuan. While Russia's modern largest city, Moscow, has the size of around 2,015.59 square km, Vietnam's size is 331,690 square km or 165 times larger than Moscow. 

So without a modern early warning system, most cities and towns of Eastern Europe and China were probably not able to prepare for a Mongol invasion or mobilize their army fast enough to choose a favorable location of their battlefields. 

From the largest freshwater lake on earth, Lake Baikal, the Mongolian genetics lineage first spread along the Orkhon river system then quickly accelerated with the adoption of large horse archers formation in their army and climate changes in the 13th century that expanded the grassland of Central Asia.

The massive grassland of Central Asia enabled the Mongolian army and their genetics to spread along from Lake Baikal to the Black Sea and Northern China with Mongol settlements being built near the Volga and Yellow river and became modern day Stalingrad and Beijing.

The spread of Central Asian horsemen genetics was only stopped by the Christian churches of Roman Empire. The Christian planners setup two traps: the fortified castles of Moscow and Constantinople to take advantages of Western European adaption to cold climate and naval strength. Moscow is too far up north and too cold for grass and horses while Constantinople is a narrow naval stroke point in a dead end. Countless horsemen of Central Asia lost their horses and lifes trying to take the two fortifed castle of Moscow and Constantinople. While Constantinople was eventually fallen, the Turkic genetic clusters lost access to the massive grassland and had to settle in a small area of Istanbul without a major river, flat highland or delta for population expansion.
