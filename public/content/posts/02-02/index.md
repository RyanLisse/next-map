### The Art of Healing and Its Brief History

Humans like other animals still follow the same patterns of genetic evolution through competition and creation. However, humans are the only animals who deeply understand ourselves. 

From the first time a human looks into his reflection in the water and becomes self aware, human knowledge about the human body and mind have grown exponentially. We started to build tools and processes to extend our biological limits. Within a tribe, there will be at least one healer with focus on reducing the chance of death and injuries for other tribe members. 

#### 10 vs 1 Soldiers, The Numerical Superiority Era

From the small human tribes with 10 or so families with basic tools and clothings, human tribes with superior organizational skills started to absorb other human tribes and develop larger settlements and form city states along major rivers.

With a large human settlement of thousands of families, we start to see the numerical superior effects. Large enough settlements will simply scare other predatory animals away as well as smaller competing tribes. 

Even with a larger settlement of 1000 families, the risk of injuries from large animals have greatly declined, human tribe membersâ€™ sickness and injuries are still part of the harsh reality of existence. And while big animals are no longer a threat, wars with other competing tribes are still the main causes of death and injuries to the tribe members.

The ancient Egyptian empire could be the apex development of this numerical superiority era. The Egyptian pharaoh was able to build a massive settlement around Cairo and the Nile rivers. The large settlement always allowed the Egyptian armies to have numerical superiority in any battles against smaller competing tribes around the Nile. 

Large city states like Cairo always had at least a 10 to 1 ratio in local battles along the Niles and were able to capture prisoners of war as slaves from smaller tribes. This numerical superiority also greatly reduces the risk of death and injuries for the Egyptian guards and its citizens as well as reducing the workload for the healers.

In order to reduce the risk of death and injuries to the Egyptian guards, the Egyptian healers were also developing snake poision arrows as offensive tools to quickly take out the enemies of Egypt. So since the Egyptian era, we started to see snakes as the symbol of healers and the healers have been developing their abilities to both cure and kill with biological and chemical means.

During the Egyptian era, we also see major stone structures being built as homes and monuments. Before man became a stone mason master, the health of himself and his family members were always at the mercy of the weather. The Egyptian mastery of stonemason skills enabled much better health for both the Egyptian rulers and their slaves. 

Even with the healers, the recovery process of sick and injured men of the ancient era was probably mainly through the self-healing ability of the human biological cells.  Large settlements with durable structures also allowed the sick and injured to recover via water and food rationing from other settlers in a much less volatile environment.
