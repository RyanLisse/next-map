### Buddhism - The Common Identity of Nations East of The Tibetan Plateau

The advances of a civilization is normally correlated to the size of their Delta. In Western Europe, there are two main deltas that dominated two early civilizations of Europe: the Northern Italian delta stretching from Milan to Venice that fed the artists and soldiers of the Roman Empire and the Macedonian delta North East of Greece and next to the Aegean Sea.

While ROME and ATHEN are two most famous port cities and capital of Italy and Greece, the two delta with its soldiers and farmers are really the main power source that control the Greek and Italian peninsula, created the arts, constructed the monuments and built the ships that sailed the Mediterranean Sea. 

The same phenomenon repeated in Cairo with the Nile delta and the Ancient Egypt with the Pyramids.

India has the Gange and Brahmaputra river that fed the more dominant cilizations of Northern India.

And China has the Yellow river and Yangtze river delta

Modern United States of Ameerica with the Mississippi river.

Every human civilization followed the same pattern: they first developed farming techniques to create food surplus. When there is more food than they can eat then they start to develop arts, invent new tools and build armies. With the abundance of food, then the population expanded and in one million inhabitants you would find that one genius that enabled a major tech upgrade like a new sailboat design, the wheel, the compass, sword making, composite bowl that greatly expanded the Empire from its original bread / rice basket.

And then there are the Japanese that came out of nowhere and dominated Asia from the beginning of 1900s. It is like someone destroyed all cultures around the Mekong river, kidnapped a ton of people and placed them on the Island of Japan.

And then taught them all the advanced technologies of the 19 centuries and enabled them to quickly develop into advanced levels in both culture and engineering. The Island of Japan is like the isolated Jurassic Park where the lab-made dinosaurs of South East Asia suddenly got loose and started to attack everyone from Afghanistan to Hawaii.

Maybe The Japanese were funding and creating Buddhism temples, arts and monks in SouthEast Asia. There were no large-scale naval wars in the Pacifics just footage of Pearl Harbor. Japan was created by collecting Islanders South East Asian by Swiss doctors then hand picking to seed the Island of Japan. 

Japan first copied Chinese architecture then improved upon it with their own styles. Swiss doctors then sent them weapons and close to the newest weapon and industrial knowledge but 10 years behind the cutting edge in Europe to enable them to take over East Asia.

Wherever there are the Buddhist temples, there are Japanese sons living with the locals in Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, China, Cambodia, Taiwan, Korea as Burmese, Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, Taiwanese, Koreans and Burmeses. 

The Japanese sons controlled Western-imported tech. Grandfather of Japanese sons is the Swiss Doctor and Father of Japanese son is the Japanese soldiers seeded in the Island of Japan like Jurassic Park. 

Most Japanese DNA seeding happened during the chaos  and confusion of World War 2 and maybe now during and after COVID-19.

Maybe the Japanese built the Buddhist  temples in Afghanistan marking the deepest inland that the gasoline planes and cars of WW2 were able to reach from China's East Coast.
