Libertas was a Roman goddess of Freedom. Her beautiful picture appeared on the gold coins that Julius Ceasar would pay his ninja assassins with. 

France originally planned to place the Statue of Liberty in Egypt next to three great pyramids to celebrate the freedom of ancient Israelians from slavery 

However, eventually,  France gave it to the United States to celebrate the passing of Thirteen amendment to abolish slavery.

### America - A British Special Economic Zone Turn Independence.

America is not really a colony like the Colonies of India or Indochina. Majority of citizens of 13 original American colonies are British and European nationals... not Natives like in India or Indochina. Itâ€™s more like a forward-deployed military base plus a special economic zone with its own set of rules and regulations.

The government structure of Native American tribes at the arrival of Columbus was very fragmented and not centralized like the Civilizations of China, India or Indochina. As a result, the Natives were quickly overrun and dominated by the newcomers from Europe. 

### America - The Rome of 21 Century 


### Every Empire Decline and America is Not the Exception.
