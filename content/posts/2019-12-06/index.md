### Only True ROMAN Can Put the World in the Enduring Path Again.

Adam Smith was the forefather of Capitalism and his unique insight helps human to organize our human capital, resources and time in an exponentially more optimized way. The religion of money aka capitalism helped to propel European nations into the leading powers in the world stage through the industrialization and scientific discovery. 

From the original Adam Smith’s vision, European philosophers and economists developed two separate branch of Economic thoughts: the English Keynesian Economics and the Austrian Economics. These two school of economic thought reflect two different economic lenses for the world. 

The Keynesian Economics derived the understanding of resources from an Island perspectives. Keynesian Economics view resources as unlimited and abundances that could be borrow from the outside world or the future to fund present economic activities. England is an Island nation with very few resources anyway so these Keynesian economic view helps them to constantly looking outside for more resources.

The Austrian Economics views resources from the perspective of a land power and evolved from the Roman Empire understanding of economics. All resources available are within the limited territorials of land. All resources spending now needs to result in a surplus to fund territorial expansion for more resources or fund scientific discovery to spend the resources more effectively to create more surplus next cycle. 

Eventually the Keynesian Economics become mainstream for most of 20 century with American and English defined how the world economics should behave in their best interests. Under the Keynesian Economics view, the world financial system is drifting further and further away from the Adam Smith’s golden standard of value: “Customer is King” to “Financier is King”.  

American and English with their absolute control of the world financial system steal and borrow without restrained from the workers, entrepreneurs of  Latin America, India, China and the rest of the value creators of the world. While the rest of the world have to work overtime to pay off debt from America after WWII, American enjoys unlimited credits to waste on fast food and drugs.

However, without enough new scientific discovery to improve productidvity or a new planet, all a Chinese or Hispanic workers can do is working 20 hours/day. He still need to eat and sleep and he can’t be 3 times more productive so American consumers can buy more McDonalds.

From 21 century, Earth and its limited resources is our Island now in Keynesian views and space is the ocean. We need to discover America first before we can try borrow from the outside world. When we run out of resources then our only options is to cannibalize each others. American and British is leading the world into a dark and dangerous path of extinction. 

Roman Republics is the among the first human civilization to figure out an economic theory to create sustainable continuous economic expansion. Great generals win battles while a superior economic model win the war. The Roman discovered the time-tested method to organize human energy and resources behind common visions. Roman Republic economic theory and philosophy also helped to create the Ottoman Empire and later on evolving into Austrian School of Economics.
