Aircraft carriers were a break-through during WWII and first used effectively and extensively by the Japanese Emperial Navy. It was a giant leap of innovation from the traditional large gun warships of German and British Navy. 

Aircraft carriers gave naval force superior range as well as much more firepower and strike frequency than large gun battleships.

American with its vast economic resources and industrial output as well as ability to break the Japanese naval communication code eventually defeated the pioneer of aircraft carrier battle group - Japanese Imperial Navy.

America also took it to another level by adding fleet of latest jet-engine aircrafts and nuclear engines to the Aircraft Carrier battle group. 

Nuclear engine essentially gives aircraft carriers unlimited range.

Last 70 years, America dominates the sea with its blue ocean navy and its superior technological as well as numerical aircraft carriers.

Will aircraft carriers become obsolate like big gun battleships during WWII with the sunk of the Bismarck and Yamato ?

### Aircraft Carrier Evolution

USS Forrestal supercarrier named after the first US Secretery of Defense - James Forrestal. 

It is the largest US Aircraft Carrier ever built and was the first to constructed with an angle flight deck, steam catapult and an optical landing system.

USS Forrestal were among the last few US aircraft carriers with conventional engine. US Navy is currently operating 10 nuclear-powered Nimitz Class aircraft carriers.

The new aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford was the 1st of its new class.
Its construction begins on Nov 13, 2009 and finally commisioned by President Donald Trump July 22, 2017.

So America currently have 11 aircraft carriers in service, a larger fleet than the rest of 7 less advanced carriers from all other countries combined. 

All American carriers are nuclear-powered while only France has one nuclear-powered Aircraft Carrier.

So is American still dominating the sea, well it is if sea power projection is based on Aircraft Carrier count.
