### Jesus - A Myth That Unite A Continent
Jesus was good for the middle age until we discovered physics. We need a new god to unite all five continents, not just one.

### Ho Chi Minh - The Unknown God of Vietnamese People
We do not need a god, we already have one for now. However, we might need a new one to dream bigger. 


### Mars and the God of War 
Will we have more wars after Mar colonialization or less wars? Does nuclear deterance matter when we have a backup planet ?

My bet is that we will nuke the shit out of each others right after we have a backup planet unless we have a new god to unite us all.
